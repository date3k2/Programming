It is true that some dynamic programming problems can be solved using a DAG (directed acyclic graph) representation. In fact, DAGs are often used to visualize the subproblems and dependencies in dynamic programming problems.

In these cases, the DAG represents the subproblems as nodes and the dependencies between them as edges. The nodes are ordered topologically, so that each node depends only on nodes that come before it. This ordering allows for efficient computation of the solutions to the subproblems.

However, it's important to note that not all dynamic programming problems can be represented using a DAG. In some cases, the dependencies between subproblems are not acyclic, which means that they cannot be represented as a DAG. In these cases, other techniques may be needed to solve the problem.

In summary, while DAGs can be a useful tool for solving some dynamic programming problems, they are not a universal solution and other techniques may be required in some cases.

Can you perform problem I asked above in DAG
The problem you asked above, finding the maximum product subarray, can be solved using dynamic programming, but it is not typically solved using a DAG.

The dynamic programming solution for this problem involves keeping track of the maximum and minimum products ending at each index in the array, and then taking the maximum of these values to find the maximum product subarray. This approach does not lend itself well to a DAG representation, as the subproblems do not have a natural ordering and are not easily represented as nodes and edges in a graph.

That being said, there may be some variations of this problem or related problems that can be represented using a DAG. For example, some problems that involve finding the shortest path in a weighted directed graph can be solved using dynamic programming and a DAG representation. However, this is a different type of problem than finding the maximum product subarray.
